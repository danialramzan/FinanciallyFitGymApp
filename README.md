# FinanciallyFit.

## Project Overview

FinanciallyFit is the implementation of a new business idea that completely revolutionizes the way gym memberships work in Java. You might've heard the phrase: "It pays to be fit!" but what if it actually paid* to be fit? That is what FinanciallyFit is. The main selling point of this gym is that along with a lower than average base fee, when you first sign up you set up a gym plan which you stick to. Whenever you attend the gym you have to log your check-in and check-out times. Every time you deviate from this plan you get charged extra in order to give you a financial incentive to stick to your routine. If you stick to your schedule, you end up getting access to a gym for a very low price. At the end of each month, the system generates a bill for each member, displaying the total amount owed based on their attendance record for the month.

## Who and Why?
This billing structure is suitable for anyone who like me, struggles to effectively commit to things and follow through with them as part of a regular routine. I had this idea for a gym billing system which would solve the problem and would me go "Hey, I'm going to lose money if I don't go to the gym today!". I believe there are many others like me who would benefit from such a fee based structure because it aligns the best interests of both your health, and your wealth. This model has the potential to make fitness more realistic to a wider audience, and I would like to implement the billing system in Java as a proof of concept to demonstrate to people how the idea can work practically.
